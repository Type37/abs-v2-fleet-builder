// The core Actions and Commands every fleet can use, transcribed verbatim from

// activation options a unit chooses in its Action Step; Commands are the things
// you spend CMD tokens on. Faction rules, HVP, and scenario rules can GRANT
// EXTRA commands or change their cost - those ride on the individual rule text
// (faction.rule, each Hvp.rule, mode rules) and are aggregated onto the printed
// sheet alongside these, so the sheet shows everything a player can actually do.
