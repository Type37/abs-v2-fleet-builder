// Working out what a fleet's rules actually DO to its commands.
//
// Faction rules, HVP and personnel routinely grant extra commands, discount core
// ones, or change how a core one resolves. Until now the sheet just said "your
// faction rule can grant more commands or change their cost - go read it", which
// pushes the lookup onto the player at the table. That is the one moment they
// have least patience for it. We know the rule text; we can read it for them.
//
// The published wording is highly regular, so this parses rather than hard-codes
// a table - a new faction written in house style is understood with no code
// change. Anything that does NOT match a known shape is deliberately left alone
// rather than guessed at: a wrong command on the sheet is far worse than a
// missing one, since the player has no reason to doubt it.

 * here is wrong. This function reads published rules text. It does not get an
 * opinion about which parts of a rule are worth printing. If a clause is
 * genuinely redundant, that is a decision for whoever writes the rule, not for a
