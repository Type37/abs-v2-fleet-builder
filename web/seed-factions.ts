// Seed custom factions: shipped as real *custom* factions (they live in the
// customFactions store, not the built-in glob) so they exercise the whole
// Foundry / export / share path. Seeded once per browser, then owned by the
// user - deleting one makes it stick (see storage.ts seedDefaultFactions).

// The Covenant (Halo). A prototype test faction: names and flavour lifted
// straight from Halo, stats hand-balanced against the twelve book factions -
// nine ship classes on the usual 3/2/2/2 Mass spread, seven personnel, costs
// and dice in the same bands as everyone else. Identity: energy shields on
// even the smallest craft, plasma that reaches, and a shield that shrugs off
// the first hit each round. Deliberately no five-kilometre supercarriers.
