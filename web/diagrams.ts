// Vector diagrams for the Learn to Play walkthrough.
//
// Each one animates, because the things being explained are movements: dice
// being rolled, a unit arriving through a jump point, a battlegroup being drawn
// around a lead ship, a hull pivoting and running forward. A static picture of a
// pivot is just an arrow, and an arrow is what the text already says.
//
// All motion is CSS (see the `learn-anim` rules in style.css) so it can be
// switched off wholesale under prefers-reduced-motion - at which point every
// diagram still reads as a labelled still, because the end state is the
// informative one and that is what the animation settles on.
//
// Geometry is drawn to scale where a distance is the point: the 6" bubbles in
// the jump and battlegroup diagrams use one unit = 4px, so a 6" radius is 24px
// against a 24px-wide hull, which is roughly the ratio on a real table.

// Position lives on an OUTER group, the animatable class on an inner one.
//
// This split is load-bearing, not tidiness. A CSS `transform` overrides an SVG
// `transform=` presentation attribute outright, so any element that carried both
// its position attribute AND an animation class whose keyframes touch transform
// lost its position the moment the animation applied: dg-roll settles on
// `translateY(0) rotate(0)` and dg-pop on `scale(1)`, both identity matrices,
// and with `animation-fill-mode: both` that identity sticks forever. Every die,
// token and arriving ship collapsed onto the SVG origin and was clipped by the
// corner of the viewBox - which is why the Command and Jump diagrams rendered as
// empty boxes with a single smudge in the top-left. Keeping the two on separate
// elements means the keyframes can own transform completely without the layout
// depending on it.

 * can lay out a real table without going back to the text. That means every
 * number in the paragraph has to appear ON the drawing: the 48x36 table, the 5"
 * inset to the flank Jump Points, the 24" between them, the 15" to the central
 * one. The previous version drew the positions correctly but dimensioned none of
 * them, so it could show you roughly where things went and never how far.
 *
 * Two things were removed to make room for those dimensions. The 6" deployment
 * bubble is drawn on each of the six Jump Points no longer - six overlapping
 * 42px halos turned the middle of the table into mud, and the 6" rule is taught
 * properly on the Jump page where it belongs. The 9" ring around the objective
 * went too: that is the Gravity Well, which has its own diagram and only applies
 * at all if the objective happens to roll up as a Planetoid.
 *
 * Only YOUR half is dimensioned. The opponent's three points are the mirror of
 * yours, so dimensioning them twice doubles the ink for no extra information.
 *
 * Dimensions are drawn against features already on the drawing - the 15" runs up
 * the centreline, the 5" up the flank point's own column - so no extension lines
 * have to be dragged across the table to reach a margin.
