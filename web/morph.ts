// Updating the page in place instead of rebuilding it.
//
// The app renders to a single HTML string and used to assign it straight to
// #app.innerHTML. That is simple and was fine for a while, but it destroys and
// recreates every node on every state change - about 150KB of DOM for one press
// of a stepper button. The costs are all things you can feel rather than
// measure:
//
//   - The button under the pointer is replaced, so it loses :hover and any
//     transition mid-flight restarts from its base state. In the builder's left
//     panel 187 elements carry a transition, so a click there flickers.
//   - Scroll positions, focus, caret and open <details> all reset, so each one
//     needed its own save/restore hook around the assignment.
//   - Any animation started by the render is wiped by the next render, which is
//     why the add-ship animation had to be ordered around the toast.
//
// So: diff the freshly rendered tree against the live one and touch only what
// actually differs. Nodes that did not change are left alone, which is what
// makes hover, transitions, scroll, focus and animations survive.
//
// This is deliberately small - no virtual DOM, no component model, no
// lifecycle. It reconciles attributes, text and children, with keys for lists
// so reordering moves nodes rather than rewriting them.

/**
 * Attributes that identify a node across renders, best first. A keyed child is
 * matched to the same key in the old tree wherever it moved to, so adding a unit
 * to the middle of the roster shifts its neighbours instead of rewriting them.
 *
 * These must be unique among siblings. Note what is NOT here: data-unit and
 * data-ship identify the unit or ship a control acts on, not the control - both
 * buttons of a stepper carry the same data-unit, so treating it as a key made
 * them collide and the (+) button got matched to the (-) slot.
