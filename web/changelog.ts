    title: "Steadier faction panel, an obvious compendium toggle, and a calmer nav",
    items: [
      "In the New Fleet faction panel, the Initiative and Command figures now sit above the signature ability text, so both plates stay in exactly the same place as you click between factions instead of drifting with the length of each rule. The command symbol is blue to match the dice and lines up beside its number.",
      "The Ship Compendium gained a clear Sort by faction checkbox, on by default, in place of the hidden behaviour where clicking the Faction column heading quietly re-grouped the table.",
      "The highlight on the top-right navigation no longer slides in from nothing every time you click something; it just rests on the current section and only moves when you hover.",
      "The Junkspace page now uses the same heading as the rest of the app rather than its own large dark banner.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.17",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Faction panel shows just the slogan",
    items: [
      "The one-line playstyle summary was dropped from the New Fleet faction panel; the faction's slogan carries the flavour on its own. The Signature ability heading below it still holds its position as you click between factions.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.16",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "New fleet button sits by the heading",
    items: [
      "The Assemble new fleet button now sits just to the right of the Fleets heading, rather than pushed out to the far edge of the page.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.15",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "One builder list, fleets as cards, and a livelier New Fleet",
    items: [
      "The builder's Ship Classes and Roster are now a single list. The units you have added sit at the top with their steppers, the rest of the faction's classes follow under an Add ships heading, and the personnel pool moved to the bottom. No more jumping between a catalogue on the right and a roster on the left.",
      "Saved fleets are shown as cards rather than table rows, each rising into place with a short stagger. When you have none, the page says so plainly and notes that all fleets are saved to your browser's cache.",
      "Learn to Play no longer drops a Training Fleet into your saved list. The tutorial is its own thing now: you play it, but it is never saved and cannot be loaded again, and any training fleets left in storage from before are cleared out.",
      "Choosing a faction in New Fleet shows its slogan, a single sentence on how it plays, its signature ability, and two figures: Initiative, with a die drawn for each you roll, and Command tokens per round marked with the command symbol. The old Ship classes and Personnel counts were dropped, and the long rulebook descriptions were replaced with that one plain sentence.",
      "The faction panel keeps its shape as you click between factions. The Signature ability heading and the figures beneath it hold their position instead of jumping around, and the four era cards are all the same size whichever era you are browsing.",
      "The home page rows regained their old hover, a blue panel that sweeps in from the left behind the text with a red leading edge, and footer links gained an underline that wipes in from the left and slides off to the right.",
      "Two new emblems, Ishtar Commander and TrueCommand, joined the picker, and the button that reveals other eras and custom factions now reads More Fleets and Custom.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.14",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Usable without a mouse, and readable on a phone",
    items: [
      "The control you just used keeps the focus. Every click used to throw focus back to the top of the page, so anyone working by keyboard had to tab all the way in again after each step, add, or removal.",
      "Weapons are readable on a phone. The five aligned columns did not fit a narrow screen and squeezed the weapon's name down to about a centimetre; the row now breaks onto two lines instead, with the name on its own line and Attack, Range and Damage labelled underneath. The wide layout is unchanged.",
      "Actions like copying or duplicating a fleet are now announced to screen readers, the page title says which view you are on, Escape closes the New Fleet dialog and any open menu, and a Skip to main content link appears when you tab into the page.",
      "Errors and warnings say which they are and carry their own symbol, instead of relying on a red-or-amber colour difference that is invisible to many readers. Placeholder text, the over-budget figure, small labels on tinted panels, and the focus ring on the blue masthead were all too faint to meet contrast guidelines and have been darkened.",
      "The plus button at a unit's maximum size no longer drops out of the keyboard order; it stays reachable and now says which unit it belongs to and what the maximum is. All the steppers name their unit rather than each announcing an identical \"one more ship\".",
      "Animations are dropped when the system asks for reduced motion, instead of only the sliding masthead highlight.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.13",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "The tutorial no longer opens broken",
    items: [
      "Combat Simulator arrives with the three Seasoned Captains the rulebook issues it (p.63), and the builder now says so: all three are listed, each with its own carrier, under a heading that reads \"Issued by the scenario\". Previously the fleet opened with two red errors complaining that Seasoned Captain was picked more than once, while the personnel list could only show one of them and offered no way to fix anything. Picking one of each remains the rule for fleets you build yourself.",
      "The Discord may take between three and five High-Value Personnel, as their Aces and Heroes rule allows. The builder always offered the choice; taking a fourth now stops reporting the fleet as illegal.",
      "The builder calls them High-Value Personnel, the rulebook's own term, rather than the \"Personnel pool\".",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.12",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Panels you open stay open",
    items: [
      "Adding a ship no longer closes the Add ships catalog you added it from, so you can add several without reopening it each time. The same fix keeps the tutorial band, your fleet notes, and the Free Play faction sections in whatever state you left them, while menus and popovers still close behind you as before.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.11",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Denser on every screen, and a print sheet that stops repeating itself",
    items: [
      "Faction entries in the New Fleet dialog are now a single original sentence on how the faction plays, in place of the transcribed rulebook briefings.",
      "Print: the Steps sheet is now just the tutorial, with no personnel list or score table stapled to the back of it. An empty personnel section no longer prints a heading over the words \"None selected\", the score table has dropped its Command tokens row (command tokens are a per-round pool, not something the rules ask you to score), and a new Rules toggle sits beside Trackers for players who know their faction rule by heart.",
      "Print: ships you have named now appear on both the roster and the cards, the sheet is dated the day you print it rather than the day you last edited the fleet, and the cards use the mass glyph instead of spelling it out.",
      "Print: the faction rule bar, the personnel bar and the tactical diagrams now survive printing with background graphics turned off, weapon columns wrap instead of running off the edge of the page, and pressing Ctrl+P on the builder now opens every tutorial step instead of printing them collapsed.",
      "Phones: the navigation is one row instead of two, the home nameplate folds to a single line, and the Fleets and Compendium tables become stacked cards with every column still labelled and readable. Nothing is hidden or truncated to make room, and no text is left below 11px.",
      "Phones: the faction list in the New Fleet dialog no longer traps your scroll, the Print button sits at the top of the print controls where you can reach it, and long faction names stop pushing the era label off the screen.",
      "Builder: the tutorial band collapses to its title after your first session, the ship catalog folds away once your fleet has ships in it, and a legal fleet no longer spends a line telling you so. Section headings are tighter throughout.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.10",
    date: "2026-07-12",
    title: "Faction briefings, straight from the rulebook",
    items: [
      "Every faction now shows its full flavour text when you pick it in the New Fleet dialog: the epigraph, the in-universe briefing (set in italic serif), and Mike Hutchinson's note on the faction's strengths and intended playstyle. All transcribed verbatim from the rulebook's Factions chapter.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.9",
    date: "2026-07-11",
    title: "Quick Reference PDF corrected and expanded",
    items: [
      "Fixed Explosion Check: the trigger is the ship's Mass, not its Silhouette. The original third-party card had it wrong; the actual rulebook says Mass.",
      "Fixed Escort and Blockade: they were combined into one bullet with the criteria swapped. They are now two separate entries with the correct tie-break for each (Escort: most ships wins; Blockade: greatest Combined Mass wins).",
      "Added Mother's Wing to the reference card (radius is 2×Mass\"; can protect Objectives) — it was on the book's own QR page but missing from our card.",
      "Added Dangerous Space rule: movement that passes through or ends in Dangerous Space inflicts a Mass×D6 attack on the unit at the end of the movement step.",
      "Added Line of Sight rule: draw lines from the attacker to each ship in the target unit; if all lines pass through Obscuring terrain the target cannot be attacked.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.8",
    date: "2026-07-11",
    title: "Quick Reference is now a proper PDF",
    items: [
      "The Quick Reference is now a downloadable PDF — a single-sheet card in the app's NASA/Swiss house style, with every section (round structure, initiative, activations, actions, all seven commands, combat rules, and the rules-you-might-forget checklist) laid out in a clean two-column format. All text is verbatim from the rulebook. Open it from the footer link.",
      "The old in-app HTML reference page has been retired in favour of the PDF.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.7",
    date: "2026-07-11",
    title: "The tutorials now print the real rules, word for word",
    items: [
      "The Combat Simulator and Management Training guides are now the rulebook's own text, transcribed verbatim rather than summarised. Every section the book prints is here in full: setup, the Central Objective table, High-Value Personnel with the Seasoned Captain and Red Alert wording, the special rules, the victory-point breakdown, and the standing rules. Both the on-screen guide and the printable \"Steps\" sheet read from the same complete text.",
      "The printable \"Steps\" sheet now lays each section out as a proper numbered walkthrough with the setup diagram in place and sub-rules as bullet lists, so it reads like a page from the book instead of a set of collapsed chips.",
      "Fixed the Mass symbol (the circled M used all through the rules) rendering as a stray \"@\" in faction rules, personnel rules, and the tutorials. It now draws as a real circled M everywhere, on screen and in print.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.6",
    date: "2026-07-11",
    title: "Printable reference, sharper rosters, and an accuracy pass",
    items: [
      "A new Quick Reference page (linked in the footer) prints the whole round structure, actions, commands, and rules-you-might-forget on one sheet, taken word for word from the rulebook. It replaces the old link to the separate PDF.",
      "The roster printout dropped its line-number column and now shows each ship's own cost alongside the stack total. Turn on Trackers to add a per-ship hull-damage box row.",
      "Shipyard modes (Hypergrowth, Management Training) now print as an actual Shipyard: a catalog of what you can requisition, with a tick box per ship to check off as it jumps into play, rather than a fixed pre-built roster.",
      "The two tutorials (Combat Simulator, Management Training) gained a \"Steps\" print layout: the full how-to-play walkthrough in plain numbered steps, for reading at the table.",
      "The Ship Compendium and each Custom Rules faction now have a \"Build a fleet with this faction\" shortcut straight into the new-fleet flow.",
      "Fixed the Combat Simulator setup diagram: the flank Jump Points are 5\" in from your own edge and the central point is 15\" in, which the previous diagram had the wrong way round.",
      "Corrected the Junkspace Gunship and Light Freighter, whose stats were entered swapped. The Light Freighter is the faster twin-Blaster hull; the Gunship is the slower Laser Cannon one.",
      "The faction rule on the Play Mode screen is no longer clipped to three lines, so long rules read in full during a game.",
      "The ship and personnel \"Add\" tiles are now reachable and operable by keyboard, and every control shows a clear focus outline when tabbed to.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.5",
    date: "2026-07-10",
    title: "Quieter hierarchy, real weapon columns, a status that fits",
    items: [
      "The weapons list was rebuilt as CSS grid instead of an HTML table, which was stretching short columns apart into huge, uneven gaps. Attack, range and damage are now tight and aligned under their own header, in both the catalog and the roster.",
      "Cut most of the black rules that made the builder feel busy: section labels (Roster, Ship classes, Personnel pool) are now quiet small-caps eyebrows instead of bold underlined headings, and the many 2px black dividers are gone except the one under the masthead.",
      "The legality status moved out of the roster and into a single small line next to the ship-buying section: a quiet checkmark when the fleet is legal, or a tiny count that opens a popover with the actual issues when it isn't.",
      "The experimental \"By mass\" ship-classes view is gone - it broke badly in narrower layouts (the Add control overlapped the weapon list). List and Compare remain.",
      "Adding a unit now shows a toast confirming what was added.",
      "The roster panel's own scroll position now survives every re-render instead of snapping back to the top - a subtler version of the same jump bug as the catalog fix.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.4",
    date: "2026-07-10",
    title: "Adding a unit no longer makes the screen jump",
    items: [
      "Tapping Add on a ship used to shove the whole catalog around. Now it doesn't move anything: the owned count is a small badge on the ship's icon (no reflow), and on phones the ship list sits above your roster, so adding to the roster grows it below your finger instead of pushing the list up.",
      "Weapons are now a proper table everywhere - one row per weapon system with its firing arc, attack dice, range and damage in aligned columns - instead of a run-on comma string.",
      "Enter Play Mode is now a full-width button at the very bottom of the whole builder, below both columns.",
      "Faction summaries are explicitly non-italic.",

  },
  {
    version: "0.8.2",
    date: "2026-07-10",
    title: "The builder works on a phone now",
    items: [
      "Mobile builder rebuilt: each unit in the manifest now stacks into a legible card (name, then stats and weapons on their own lines, then a controls row with the ship-count stepper and cost), instead of five kinds of data crushed into one unreadable line. Nothing is clipped and there is no more sideways scrolling.",
      "Carried personnel are tappable everywhere they appear on a unit: tap a name like \"Seasoned Captain\" to see exactly what they do, in a popover that shifts nothing.",
      "The fleet header is reorganised: the budget sits on its own line under the name so the big figure never gets clipped, and a single dots (More) menu now holds Print, Share link, Duplicate, and Delete.",
      "Play Mode is now a full-width call-to-action at the foot of the manifest - the clear next step - with Notes tucked below it.",
      "The New Fleet dialog's faction preview is now just the summary and signature ability, not a full ship-and-personnel dump. The era switcher fits and slides cleanly on a phone.",
      "Faction pickers are grouped by era (Hypergrowth, Age of Unity, Armageddon) with custom factions gathered at the bottom, and every faction box is now the same size, so long names like The Alliance of Non-Human Worlds no longer blow out the grid.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.1",
    date: "2026-07-10",
    title: "Unit and personnel modals are gone",
    items: [
      "Units are auto-numbered instead of labelled \"Ship Name unit\": the first Warcry Fighter Wing you add is \"Warcry Fighter Wing\", the second is \"Warcry Fighter Wing 2\", and so on. Click straight into the name to override it - no modal, no duplicated name line.",
      "The unit configuration modal is gone. Ship count, species (Alliance only), carried-personnel count, and remove are all inline on the roster row now.",
      "The personnel config popover is gone too: assigning who carries a chosen HVP is a plain dropdown right on its row. Renaming an HVP is off the table for now.",
      "The faction picker in the manifest header now matches the dotted-underline style of the fleet name and credits cap, instead of a bold underlined button.",
    ],

  {
    version: "0.8.0",
    date: "2026-07-10",
    title: "The builder becomes a manifest, Play Mode becomes a real tutorial",
    items: [
      "The builder is rebuilt as a flat manifest ledger instead of a setup-band-plus-two-column layout: a masthead with a live budget meter, a sticky fleet manifest, and a ship/personnel yard. No SaaS-style cards, no truncation anywhere - full weapon stats and personnel rules are always visible.",
      "The ship catalog is a single click target per row (whole row adds a unit, with an always-visible ADD cue and an owned-count tag), and gets a new Compare view: a bar chart ranking every ship class in the faction by cost, mass, thrust, silhouette, or shields.",
      "Personnel are one self-contained card each: adding one opens its carried-by assigner immediately, in the same click, with zero layout shift. Only one of each HVP type may ride in a fleet (designer-confirmed); duplicates are blocked and flagged.",
      "A new segmented switcher (sliding highlight, one bordered track) replaces plain button rows anywhere there are 2 or more mutually exclusive options: the ship-classes view, the New Fleet era picker, and the Play Mode phase tracker.",
      "The Foundry's \"Forge a new faction\" now opens a picker of every existing faction, official or custom, to start from and rename - not just a blank sheet.",
      "Play Mode is a real tutorial now: each of the four round phases is a genuine checklist you tick off at the table (not a paragraph to interpret yourself), the primary action (Next phase) is a real call-to-action, and two original diagrams - a measured table/deployment layout and a firing-arc illustration - replace text-only description for the two hardest-to-picture concepts. Small firing-arc glyphs also sit permanently next to every ship's Primary/Auxiliary weapon stats.",
      "Home page rows are narrower with a \"Get the rulebook\" link alongside them; typography across the app was rebalanced so decorative labels stop competing with buttons and real content for attention.",
