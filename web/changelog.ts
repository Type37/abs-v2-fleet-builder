    version: "0.8.50",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Solo reads like the rest of the app",
    items: [
      "The solo outfit sheet drops its solid blue banner and boxed border for the same flat, ruled look the fleet builder uses. It was the loudest thing on the page and made solo feel like a different app from the builder sitting next to it.",
      "Cleared out the styles left behind by the roster and print-card rework.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.49",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Rows use the space they're given",
    items: [
      "Fleet roster rows put the stats beside the weapons table instead of stacked above it, which closes the wide empty gap on the right and makes each row shorter.",
      "Solo outfit rows do the same, with the pilot controls sitting alongside the ship's spec rather than underneath a half-empty row. Both stack back to one column on a narrow screen.",
      "Adding a ship in solo now confirms it with a message, and tells you when the outfit is full at five.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.48",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Hypergrowth is a shipyard, not a list of units",
    items: [
      "In Hypergrowth you now stock ship classes, not units. Adding a ship puts one in the shipyard; every add after that just raises how many of that class you hold. No units are formed, nothing gets named, and the panel says \"Your shipyard, 2 ship classes\" instead of talking about units. Units are only formed when you requisition them, in play.",
      "Every stat now shows its word as well as its symbol, everywhere, in a condensed face so it costs almost no room. A bare icon and a number was a puzzle.",
      "Weapon tables read Range before Attack, and each arc shows PRI or AUX as a word first with the wedge after it.",
      "Print cards use the same stat chips and weapon table as the rest of the app, and no longer print the ship's name twice.",
      "The fleet builder's two columns are more evenly split, so the ship picker on the right has room to breathe and the roster stops banking dead space beside its weapon table.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.47",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Solo mode stops looking squashed",
    items: [
      "The solo workspace had its columns the wrong way round: the outfit list, which holds at most five ships, was taking the wide side while the ship picker was crushed into a narrow one. The picker was so tight that the ADD button ran into the damage column and the header note got cut off. Both columns are now split the same way as the fleet builder, and the picker has room to breathe.",
      "Ships in your outfit now show their weapons in exactly the same table as the picker beside them, instead of a different text layout, so a ship reads the same whether you're choosing it or you already own it.",
      "Weapon tables now fold themselves neatly whenever their column is narrow, whatever the window size, so nothing can overlap or spill again.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.46",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Preview shows collapsed sections expanded, like the printer will",
    items: [
      "Anything that prints expanded now shows expanded in the preview too, so the page count can't under-report by hiding folded-away content.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.45",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Print setup finally shows you the actual pages",
    items: [
      "The preview is now laid out at the real printable width of the paper, with a dashed line and a label everywhere the page will actually break. What you see is what comes out of the printer.",
      "It tells you the page count next to the Print button, and every option updates it straight away — turn the rules off and watch it drop from two pages to one, so you can see what a choice costs in paper before you commit.",
      "Choose Letter or A4, and the whole preview relays out to match.",
      "Ink saver, on by default: no coloured fills or bars, so the sheet looks the same whether or not your browser prints backgrounds, and it uses far less toner.",
      "Leave individual units out of a printout with the small cross beside each one, without touching the fleet itself. A note tells you what's held back and puts it all back in one click.",
      "Your print setup is remembered, so reprinting after an edit is one click.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.44",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "A damage mark of its own",
    items: [
      "Damage now has its own symbol, a hull struck side-on, in a hot red that's deliberately not the same red as an over-budget warning. It marks the damage column on every weapon table.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.43",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "The printed sheet tells you if the list is legal",
    items: [
      "The print header now shows the unit count and whether the fleet is legal, so the sheet you hand across the table is also the proof it checks out. It follows the mode: an Armageddon list without its HVP reads \"to resolve\", while a Hypergrowth Shipyard that doesn't take HVP reads \"Legal\".",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.42",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Cleaner page breaks when you actually print",
    items: [
      "On paper, an action or command is never split from its own rules text across a page break, and a section heading is never left stranded at the bottom of a page.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.41",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Nothing scrolls sideways on a phone any more",
    items: [
      "Fixed pages sliding left and right on a narrow screen. The print sheet and the solo tab bar were stretching the whole page instead of scrolling on their own, so the print roster, the score table, and the outfit tabs now stay put and scroll within themselves. Checked every page at phone width.",
      "Solo roster ships show their stats and weapons on their own full-width lines instead of being squashed into a column.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.40",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Play Mode shows the commands you can use right now",
    items: [
      "Play Mode now lists the commands you can actually spend CMD tokens on in the phase you're in, with the cost and the full effect text, so you never go hunting through the rulebook mid-turn. Commands you can't currently afford are dimmed, and the Jump Phase only offers Requisition in the Shipyard modes where it exists.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.39",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Bigger emblems everywhere, and a tidy-up under the hood",
    items: [
      "Emblems are bigger across the app now, not just in the builder header: fleet cards, the print sheet, solo outfit cards, and the outfit roster all show a larger mark.",
      "Cleared out the code left behind by the picker rework: the old inline emblem pickers and their styles are gone, which trims the stylesheet and keeps the app quick to load.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.38",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "The sigil picker sorts and searches properly",
    items: [
      "Search the sigil library by name, and the folders now read A to Z with a count on each, with the loose-files General bucket last where it belongs.",
      "Sigil names are cleaned up: the boilerplate in the source filenames is stripped and run-together names are split into words, so a sigil is listed as \"Arcus Tigers\" rather than \"HINF Emblem icon Arcus Tigers\". Searching actually finds things now.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.37",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Solo catalogue matches the fleet builder, and the emblem picker grows up",
    items: [
      "The solo Stock Ship Classes catalogue now looks and behaves exactly like the fleet builder's: click the whole row to add, compact stat chips, and the same aligned PRI/AUX weapons table.",
      "The emblem library is now organised into folders you can filter by, and the sigil tiles sit on a faint checkerboard so all-white marks are visible while you browse. The mouseover labels are gone.",
      "New emblem customisation for fleets, custom factions, and solo outfits alike: pick a background colour behind any sigil (great for all-white marks) and, for vector marks, a tint colour — all from the Colour tab.",
      "The emblem in the builder header is bigger.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.36",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Hypergrowth is 300 or Unlimited, and solo ships show their stats",
    items: [
      "Hypergrowth's credits are now just what they should be: a 300bn cap or Unlimited Shipyards, with no 400/500 or custom amount cluttering it — in both the New Fleet card and the builder.",
      "Every ship in a solo outfit now shows its full stats (Mass, Thrust, Silhouette, Shields) and both weapon lines right in the roster, so you can see what each pick does without leaving the page.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.35",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "Unlimited Shipyards, matching builder controls, and Age of Unity HVP on print",
    items: [
      "Hypergrowth now has an Unlimited Shipyards switch (off by default) in the credits popover: turn it on and the 300bn cap comes off entirely — the tally reads ∞ and nothing counts as over budget.",
      "The builder's credits control now matches the New Fleet card: the same preset buttons and the same click-to-open Custom field.",
      "Age of Unity prints for its deferred HVP: every ship gets an HVP write-in slot, and the sheet lists every High-Value Personnel available to the faction with a line to note who carries each once your missions are generated.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.34",
    date: "2026-07-18",
    title: "One emblem picker everywhere: a Choose-emblem dialog with tabs",
    items: [
      "The emblem picker is now the same everywhere — the fleet builder, Custom Rules, and solo outfits all use a single \"Choose emblem\" button that opens one dialog. It has Library, Upload, and (for fleets) Colour tabs, with the full icon library given real room to browse instead of a cramped popover. Pick an icon and the dialog stays open so you can keep trying; Done closes it.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.33",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Shorter share links and a solo menu that shows your campaign",
    items: [
      "Share links are now compressed, so they're much shorter — especially fleets that carry a custom faction. Old links still work.",
      "The Solo landing page now shows each outfit as a card with a debt progress bar and how many games you have left to clear it, so you can see where every campaign stands at a glance.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.32",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "A print sheet that replaces the rulebook, and a clearer solo builder",
    items: [
      "Print mode is tighter and printer-friendly: the section headings are no longer solid dark bars that drink toner, spacing is much denser, and it now prints an Actions & Commands reference — every action and every command with its CMD cost and full effect text, taken verbatim from the Quick Reference. Requisition only shows in the Shipyard modes. Your faction rule and carried HVP still print in full, since that's where extra commands come from.",
      "Solo pilot-class picker is now a compact chip for each class, and it shows the selected class's actual ability (Hot Shot, Tough, Smartass) right below, so you know what it does.",
      "Custom Rules factions now have a proper Duplicate button (makes an editable copy in the app) alongside Copy and Download.",
      "Uploading a ship image is now an obvious click-to-upload tile instead of a tiny button.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.31",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Learn to Play is a real guided walkthrough now",
    items: [
      "Learn to Play from the home menu now opens a five-step walkthrough instead of dropping you in the builder. It sets the scene (it's a two-player game), hands you the ready-made Training Fleet with its stats, walks the four-round structure with a looping move-then-shoot animation, shows the table and how you score, then loads the fleet straight into Play Mode.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.30",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Per-mode HVP, a reworked emblem picker, and a tighter builder header",
    items: [
      "HVP now follows the mode. Hypergrowth is a Shipyard and shows no HVP at build. Age of Unity treats HVP as optional at build and tells you they're assigned after the missions are generated. Only Armageddon still requires them chosen up front. No more spurious 'must select HVP' error on the modes that defer them.",
      "The emblem picker is reworked everywhere it's used (Custom Rules, solo outfits): a large preview beside clearly labelled Upload, Library, Random, and Remove actions. The library now opens in a panel you can close with an X.",
      "The builder header is a single line now: name, faction, era badge, and budget all on one row, and the whole builder is no longer stretched too wide.",
      "Custom Rules can start from a template you rename and edit: an Enemy Pirate Fleet or a Solo Fleet.",
      "Removed the 'Smaller game / Larger game' toast when changing the credits limit.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.29",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Steadier Armageddon slam, tighter red underline",
    items: [
      "The Armageddon title slam no longer shakes the screen on a long faction name like the Alliance of Non-Human Worlds. The scale-in is centred and bounded, and the panel clips so the animation can never spill out and toggle a scrollbar.",
      "Raised the red underline on the faction title so it sits right under the name instead of floating low beneath it.",
      "New Solo Play blurb on the home menu: \"Solitaire narrative campaign. Now with Debt!\"",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.28",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "A clearer builder header, labelled weapon arcs, and a tidier footer",
    items: [
      "The builder header is tighter and reads on fewer lines: the era you're building for is now a bold badge up top so it's unmistakable, and the big credits figure sits out to the right instead of leaving a wide empty gap.",
      "Weapon tables now label each arc PRI or AUX in words alongside the arc icon, and the table only takes the width it needs rather than stretching the figures far from the weapon name.",
      "The fleet Actions menu on the builder is now a proper labelled button, not a bare set of dots.",
      "The top navigation now matches the home menu in order, and adds a Learn to Play entry. Cleaner Options icon.",
      "The Junkspace intro reads as flavor text now: serif, with a red rule down the side. The footer drops its dot separators for plain spacing.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.27",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "The command tokens draw themselves in again, and the Armageddon slam is back",
    items: [
      "Command tokens on the New Fleet card draw themselves in and swell to full, one after another, the way they used to. They still show one triangle per token so the count reads at a glance.",
      "Armageddon titles get their original slam back: the name lands big from above, overshoots, and jolts once on impact before settling. It was more fun to watch than the quieter thump, so it's back.",
      "On the New Fleet card, Credits limit \"Custom\" is now just a word until you click it. Click it and it opens into a field to type your own cap.",
      "The builder now offers both ways to finish at the foot of your fleet: Enter Play Mode and Print setup sit together as a pair. Print used to be tucked away in the overflow menu.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.26",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Two-column builder: your fleet on the left, the catalogue on the right",
    items: [
      "The builder is back to a straightforward two-column layout. Your fleet sits on the left and follows you down the page; the full ship-class catalogue is on the right. Click a ship on the right and it drops into your fleet on the left, where you set its count and carried personnel.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.25",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "A properly centred Mass symbol, distinct era buttons, tighter slam",
    items: [
      "The circled Mass symbol in rules text is now drawn as an SVG with the M centred exactly, instead of a bordered text box that could never line the letter up reliably.",
      "The era chooser in New Fleet is now three separate buttons that each name what you build with it (a Shipyard for Hypergrowth, a Fleet List for Age of Unity and Armageddon).",
      "The Armageddon title's red underline now draws in the instant the name lands, rather than after the whole bounce settles.",
    ],
  },
  {
    version: "0.8.24",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Layout fix, tidier compendium controls, and small faction-panel touches",
    items: [
      "Fixed a layout regression from the footer change: the main content had gone narrow and centred and the fleet cards stacked into a single column. The page is full width again and the cards tile properly.",
      "In the Ship Compendium, the Sort by faction and Show custom ships toggles now sit in the same bar as the search and dropdowns, in a conventional order, with the result count on its own line beneath.",
      "Choosing a credits limit now shows a brief Smaller game or Larger game note.",
      "Machine-log faction slogans (AEGIS, Golem) now read as a terminal line: monospace, upright, with a blinking cursor.",
      "The command-tokens-per-round figure now shows that many triangle marks, mirroring the initiative dice, and the version and changelog link moved out of the footer into the Options dialog.",

    version: "0.8.23",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "A real pilot-class picker, and ships that arrive with a flourish",
    items: [
      "In Solo, choosing a pilot is now a prominent three-way picker with the Gunner, Hauler, and Junker artwork instead of a plain dropdown, and the separate starting-perks reference box has been removed.",
      "Adding a ship to a fleet or a Solo outfit now plays a short entrance on just the new row, so the addition registers at a glance.",

    version: "0.8.22",
    date: "2026-07-17",
    title: "Dice on the value's line, and better title motion",
    items: [
      "In the faction panel, the Initiative dice and the command symbol now sit on the same line as their value (3D6 shown with three dice, the command total with its mark), and the glyphs pop in with a short stagger.",
      "Age of Unity titles now recede into place like the Star Wars logo, arriving huge and distant and settling as they fade up.",

    title: "Options menu with backups, and custom ships in the compendium",
    items: [
      "A new Options button in the top bar opens a dialog for your data: export a backup of every fleet, outfit, and custom faction to a file, import one back (to move between devices), or clear everything. It also gathers the about-and-links in one place.",

      "The High-Value Personnel list in Custom Rules is now numbered.",

      "When you pick a faction in New Fleet, its name now plays a short entrance that matches the era. Hypergrowth names flicker through random glyphs and settle left to right; Age of Unity names wipe in from the left in blue; Armageddon names slam in oversized, shudder, and land, then a red underline draws in beneath them.",
